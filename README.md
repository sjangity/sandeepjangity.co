Welcome to my personal portfolio - a React SPA implementation.

### The Objective

A standard master-detail interface fairly conventional in the native mobile world to highlight my experience as a Full-Stack Web and Mobile developer over the last 11-years.

### Deploy Script
> [Compile/Build](https://github.com/sjangity/startup-stack/blob/master/pull-static.sh) Used to deploy React SPA onto VPS.

### TOP ISSUES (outstanding)

> [#1](https://github.com/sjangity/sandeepjangity.co/issues/1) VPS shows the app build folder generates 300MB quickly leading to disk-space issues on an already constrained server resource. We should patch the build process with an initial hack of keeping the last 3 builds and truncating the rest.
